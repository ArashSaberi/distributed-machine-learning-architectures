# Distributed machine learning architectures

## Architectures
In the **architectures** folder, we can find the actual implementation and the corresponding mapping to fog√ò5 of the distributed architectures. 

## Analyzer
In the **analyzer** folder, you can find a script that permits to analyze various parameters of the gossip learning and federated learning architectures.

## Dataset
In the **dataset** folder, you can find the dataset used to test the aforementioned architectures, along with a script to auto-generate a training dataset for the cloud-centric and cloud-edge-thing architectures.
